            ## Release Summary
            
            This deployment will apply all available migrations to initialize the database schema.
            
            ## Safety Information
            
            ### First Deployment Checklist
            - [ ] Database backup strategy is in place
            - [ ] All required database users and permissions are configured
            - [ ] Connection pooling and timeout settings are appropriate
            - [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured
            - [ ] Rollback procedures are understood and tested
            
            ### Post-Deployment Verification
            - [ ] Verify flyway_schema_history table was created
            - [ ] Confirm all migrations applied successfully
            - [ ] Test application connectivity and basic functionality
            
            **For detailed migration information, refer to files in the `migrations/` directory.**
