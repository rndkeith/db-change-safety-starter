# Database Migration Rollback Playbook

This playbook provides step-by-step procedures for rolling back database migrations in emergency situations.

## üö® When to Rollback

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
Execute rollback immediately if:
- **Data corruption detected** - Tables or relationships compromised
- **Application cannot start** - Critical database connectivity issues
- **Performance degradation >50%** - Queries performing significantly slower
- **Business process failure** - Core functionality completely broken
- **Security vulnerability introduced** - Data exposure or access control issues

### Escalation Before Rollback
Consider escalation first if:
- **Minor performance issues** - <20% degradation
- **Non-critical feature impact** - Secondary functionality affected
- **Intermittent issues** - Problems that resolve themselves
- **User experience degradation** - Slowness but functionality intact

## üîÑ Rollback Decision Matrix

| Risk Level | Issue Severity | Decision | Timeline |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Low | Critical | Rollback | Within 30 minutes |
| Low | Major | Escalate ‚Üí Rollback | Within 2 hours |
| Low | Minor | Monitor ‚Üí Rollback if worsens | Within 24 hours |
| Medium | Critical | Rollback | Within 15 minutes |
| Medium | Major | Rollback | Within 1 hour |
| Medium | Minor | Escalate ‚Üí Rollback | Within 4 hours |
| High | Any | Rollback | Within 10 minutes |

## üõ†Ô∏è Rollback Methods

### Method 1: Forward Migration (Preferred)
**When to use:** Schema changes that can be undone with additional migrations  
**Timeline:** 30-60 minutes  
**Risk:** Low  

```sql
-- Example: Rolling back an added column
ALTER TABLE dbo.Orders DROP COLUMN status;
DROP INDEX IX_Orders_status ON dbo.Orders;
```

**Steps:**
1. Create new migration file with rollback SQL
2. Test rollback migration in staging
3. Execute Flyway migrate in production
4. Validate changes successful
5. Run smoke tests

### Method 2: Flyway Undo (If Available - Requires Teams+ License)
**When to use:** Flyway Teams/Enterprise with undo migrations  
**Timeline:** 15-30 minutes  
**Risk:** Medium  
**Requires:** Flyway Teams+ license and undo migration files

```bash
# Execute undo migration (Teams+ feature)
flyway -configFiles=flyway/conf.prod.conf undo
```

**Steps:**
1. Verify undo migration exists and you have Teams+ license
2. Backup current state
3. Execute flyway undo command
4. Validate rollback successful
5. Update application if needed

**Note:** This requires Flyway Teams+ subscription and pre-written undo migrations.

### Method 3: Database Restore (Last Resort)
**When to use:** Critical failures, data corruption, or complex rollbacks  
**Timeline:** 2-6 hours depending on database size  
**Risk:** High - Data loss possible  

**Steps:**
1. **STOP** all application traffic immediately
2. Document all data changes since migration
3. Restore from pre-migration backup
4. Apply transaction log backups (if point-in-time recovery)
5. Restart applications with previous code version
6. Validate business operations

## üìã Rollback Procedures by Change Type

### Adding Tables/Columns (Additive Changes)
**Risk:** Low  
**Method:** Forward migration or undo  

```sql
-- Rollback: Drop the added elements
DROP TABLE dbo.NewTable;
ALTER TABLE dbo.ExistingTable DROP COLUMN new_column;
```

**Validation:**
- Verify application starts without errors
- Check that removed schema elements aren't referenced
- Run full smoke test suite

### Modifying Columns (Data Type Changes)
**Risk:** High  
**Method:** Depends on complexity  

**For widening changes (VARCHAR(50) ‚Üí VARCHAR(100)):**
```sql
-- Usually safe to leave as-is, monitor for issues
-- If rollback needed:
ALTER TABLE dbo.Products ALTER COLUMN name VARCHAR(50);
```

**For narrowing changes (requires careful handling):**
```sql
-- May require data validation before rollback
-- Check for data that won't fit in smaller type
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.Products WHERE LEN(name) > 50;
-- Proceed only if no data loss
```

### Adding Indexes
**Risk:** Very Low  
**Method:** Forward migration  

```sql
-- Rollback: Simply drop the index
DROP INDEX IX_NewIndex ON dbo.TableName;
```

### Data Seeding/Updates
**Risk:** Medium to High  
**Method:** Depends on data criticality  

**For reference data:**
```sql
-- Rollback: Delete inserted records
DELETE FROM dbo.AppConfig WHERE config_key IN ('new_setting1', 'new_setting2');
```

**For business data:**
- Usually requires database restore
- Document all changes for manual reversal
- Consider data loss implications

### View/Stored Procedure Changes
**Risk:** Low to Medium  
**Method:** Forward migration  

```sql
-- Rollback: Deploy previous version
DROP VIEW dbo.vw_NewView;
-- Recreate previous version from source control
```

## ‚ö° Emergency Rollback (Under 10 Minutes)

### Critical System Failure Response

1. **Immediate Actions (0-2 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Stop application traffic
   # Disable health checks to prevent automatic restart
   
   # Quick assessment
   echo "Checking database connectivity..."
   sqlcmd -S server -d database -Q "SELECT 1"
   ```

2. **Fast Rollback (2-8 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Quick forward migration (if SQL ready)
   flyway -configFiles=flyway/conf.prod.conf migrate
   
   # Option B: Restore from backup (if automated)
   # [Specific restore commands for your environment]
   ```

3. **Immediate Validation (8-10 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Restart application
   # Verify critical paths working
   # Basic smoke test
   dotnet run --project tools/smoke-test
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **Speed vs. Accuracy:** In emergencies, prioritize system stability over perfect procedure adherence
2. **Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process
3. **Documentation:** Record all actions for post-incident analysis
4. **Testing:** Regularly practice rollback procedures to maintain readiness
5. **Escalation:** Don't hesitate to escalate if uncertain about the right approach

**Remember: A successful rollback is not a failure - it's a demonstration of good engineering practices and risk management.**
