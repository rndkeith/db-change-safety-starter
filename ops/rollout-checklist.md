- [ ] **Application team on standby** - Development team available for issues
- [ ] **Operations team notified** - Monitoring and incident response team aware

## üöÄ Deployment Execution

### Pre-Deployment Checks
- [ ] **Database health verified** - No existing issues or long-running transactions
- [ ] **Application status confirmed** - Systems stable and ready for changes
- [ ] **Monitoring systems active** - Database and application monitoring enabled
- [ ] **Rollback plan reviewed** - Team understands revert procedures

### Migration Execution

- [ ] **Dry run completed** (if applicable) - Generated SQL reviewed and approved
- [ ] **Migration executed** - Flyway migrate command successful
- [ ] **Schema history updated** - Flyway tracking table reflects new migrations

### Immediate Validation
- [ ] **Migration status verified** - All migrations marked as successful
- [ ] **Smoke tests executed** - Automated validation tests passed
- [ ] **Application connectivity tested** - Database connections working
- [ ] **Critical queries tested** - Key business operations functional

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Performance Validation (First 30 minutes)
- [ ] **Query performance monitored** - Response times within expected ranges
- [ ] **Lock contention checked** - No excessive blocking detected
- [ ] **Resource utilization normal** - CPU, memory, and I/O within limits
- [ ] **Error log reviewed** - No migration-related errors detected

### Application Health (First 2 hours)
- [ ] **Application startup successful** - All services started without errors
- [ ] **Business processes functional** - Critical workflows operating normally

### Extended Monitoring (First 24 hours)
- [ ] **Performance trending reviewed** - Sustained performance within SLA
- [ ] **Business metrics validated** - Key indicators remain stable
- [ ] **User feedback monitored** - No migration-related issues reported
- [ ] **System stability confirmed** - No unexpected behavior observed

## ‚úÖ Deployment Sign-off

### Technical Validation
- [ ] **Database engineer approval** - DBA confirms successful migration
- [ ] **Application team approval** - Development team validates functionality
- [ ] **Operations team approval** - Infrastructure team confirms stability
- [ ] **Performance validation complete** - Metrics within acceptable ranges

### Business Validation

- [ ] **User acceptance confirmed** - No critical issues reported
- [ ] **Business continuity validated** - Operations proceeding normally
- [ ] **Success criteria met** - All deployment objectives achieved

### Documentation

## üö® Emergency Procedures

If critical issues are encountered during deployment:

1. **STOP** - Halt the migration process immediately
2. **ASSESS** - Evaluate the severity and impact
3. **COMMUNICATE** - Notify stakeholders and escalate appropriately
4. **ROLLBACK** - Execute rollback procedures if necessary
5. **DOCUMENT** - Record all actions taken and lessons learned

### Emergency Contacts
- **On-Call DBA:** [Insert 24/7 contact]
- **DevOps Lead:** [Insert contact]
- **Application Manager:** [Insert contact]
- **Business Stakeholder:** [Insert contact]

## üìã Rollout Variations

### Zero-Downtime Deployment
For online migrations with no maintenance window:
- Verify all operations are online-compatible
- Monitor for lock escalation
- Have immediate rollback capability
- Coordinate with load balancer configuration

### Maintenance Window Deployment
For migrations requiring downtime:
- Coordinate maintenance window with business
- Plan application shutdown sequence
- Verify rollback time within window
- Test full startup procedure

### High-Risk Migration
For complex or high-impact changes:
- Require additional approvals
- Extend monitoring period to 72 hours
- Keep rollback window open longer
- Schedule follow-up review meeting

**Remember: When in doubt, escalate. It's better to delay deployment than to cause a production incident.**
